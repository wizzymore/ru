ru is a simple and easy-to-use cli tool inspired by `du` to find out the size of files/directories.

The motivation behind this project is to have a safe, performant and cross platform way of measure size of folders and files.

### Usage

Install the tool:

```shell
cargo install --git https://github.com/wizzymore/ru
```

Use the tool with the `ru` binary:

```shell
ru -d 1 --sort .
```

ru is a simple and easy-to-use cli tool inspired by `du` to find out the disk usage of files/directories.

The motivation behind this project is to have a safe, performant and cross platform way to measure disk usage of folders and files.

### Usage

Install the tool:

```shell
cargo install ru
```

Use the tool with the `ru` binary:

```shell
ru .
```
